### Wallpaper
Just a few wallpapers that I like.
## Road Map
* Create some script that will generate html and this [README.md](https://github.com/a13ks3y/wallpaper/edit/master/README.md) file, probably like a corn-job, or watch file system, or git-hooks. So when I add the image, it will update index.html and README.md 
* Create some node script to implement basic todo app from cli that will
generate wallpaper(s) with todo items just on the surface of the image
maybe transparent.
Cli example:

Create todo
```bash
    wallpaper-todo --add "Buy some milk"
```
Mark as done (by number)
```bash
    wallpaper-todo --remove 1
```
List
```bash
    wallpaper-todo --list
```
Etc.
* Make web-interface for cli util described above.
